# 🔐 E2EE Chat App - Version 3

This is a console-based End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) chat application built using **Python** and **Flask**, designed for secure real-time messaging between two parties. It supports **three modern encryption schemes** for secure communication:

- 🛡️ **RSA + AES-GCM**
- 🔐 **X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305**
- 🔁 **Diffie-Hellman + AES-GCM**

---

## 📦 Features

- Secure key exchange and message encryption
- Multiple encryption algorithms to choose from
- Flask-based minimal backend
- HTML interface with dynamic contact loading
- Real-time message updates (client-side polling)
- Python-native crypto implementation using `cryptography` and `nacl`

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Flask** – for backend server and routing
- **HTML + JS** – frontend UI for messaging
- **Cryptography** – for RSA, AES-GCM, DH
- **PyNaCl** – for X25519 and ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **JSON** – for local message + key storage
